Instructions unique to win32 builds.

Grab ming32:

I build the dll with jdk-1.2.2 for linux using jdk-1.2.2 include files from 
win32.

Make sure that ming32 bin dir is the first in your path

export PATH="/usr/local/cross-tools/i386-mingw32/bin/:$PATH:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/local/java/bin:/usr/local/java/jre/bin/:"

Place Sun jdk 1.2.2 win32 include files in a known location.
	mkdir /home/jarvi/win32java
	cp -r /mnt/win98/.../java/include /home/jarvi/win32java

run configure to generate a Makefile
	cd /home/jarvi/rxtx-*
	mkdir build
	cd build
	../configure --target=i386-mingw32 --host=i386-redhat-linux

build the class files and dll.
	make jcl
	make borg

	the files will be located in
	rxtx-*/build/...

Hope that helps.  Send in additional comments if its not clear.
