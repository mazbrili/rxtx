Instructions unique to win32 builds.

Grab ming32:

	Wayne Roberts has the version used by the maintainer.
	(Wayne is largly responsible for bringing rxtx back to win32.)
	ftp://24.1.180.14/pub

I built the dll with jdk-1.2.2 for linux using jdk-1.2.2 include files from 
win32.

Make sure that ming32 bin dir is the first in your path (at least before /usr/bin/gcc)

export PATH="/usr/local/cross-tools/i386-mingw32/bin/:$PATH:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/local/java/bin:/usr/local/java/jre/bin/:"

Place Sun jdk 1.2.2 win32 include files in a known location.
	mkdir /home/jarvi/win32java
	cp -r /mnt/win98/.../java/include /home/jarvi/win32java

run configure to generate a Makefile
	cd /home/jarvi/rxtx-*
	mkdir build
	cd build
	../configure --target=i386-mingw32 --host=i386-redhat-linux

build the class files and dll.
	make jcl
	make borg

	the files will be located in
	rxtx-*/build/...

Hope that helps.  Send in additional comments if its not clear.

If your looking at rxtx as an example of crosscompiling you may be interested
in looking at the examples provided at:

(thanks to Wayne Roberts for pointing this out)
