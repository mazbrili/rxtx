For now I've added a make rule for jcl (java comm for linux).  

Make sure the files (javax.comm.* and java.comm.*)  from sun are in the 
CLASSPATH your environment had when you typed configure.

make jcl to produce the required classes. 

---------------------------------
Dont use the win32 CommAPI files.  Get the solaris flavor when you download 
CommAPI or You'll get up with

   java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: nSetOwner while loading driver 
   gnu.io.RXTXCommDriver

SetOwner appears to be some nt/win32 call.
--------------------------------
You'll also need to have the following in .../java/lib/javax.comm.properties
#SEE: commapi/PlatformSpecific.html from Sun's commapi package for details.
Driver=gnu.io.RXTXCommDriver

--------------------------------
David J Atkinson says:

The changes I have made mainly evolve around including event notification
and non-blocking or the ports. to do this I have consulted the source code
of minicom. I have also implemented hardware flow control as this was necessary
for a modem monitoring program I have developed. There are a number of things
no implemented yet and they will be signalled when called by a line like
notifyOnBreakInterrupt Fixme!

The things I haven't implemented are those I don't know enough about.
To install of rxtx-1.2pre4 simply untar the file in a separate directory and 
replace the files as detailed below. After this run ./configure as Makefile.in 
has changed. 

To make successfully I needed to use JDKHOME
therefore I configured with
export JDK_HOME=/usr/local/jdk1.1.6
./configure --enable-JDKHOME

then run
make
make jcl

To use this version you must use javacomm20 or higher. I used "javacomm20-x86.tar.Z" for the comm.jar files and also includes some examples. To run the examples I changed the port opening checks to look for /dev/cua0 as my linux didn't have the same devices as the samples expect. 

Good Luck
