For now I've added a make rule for jcl (java comm for linux).  

Make sure the files (javax.comm.* and java.comm.*)  from sun are in the 
CLASSPATH your environment had when you typed configure.

make jcl to produce the required jar. 

---------------------------------
Dont use the win32 CommAPI files.  Get the solaris flavor when you download 
CommAPI or You'll get up with

   java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: nSetOwner while loading driver 
   gnu.io.RXTXCommDriver

SetOwner appears to be some nt/win32 call.
--------------------------------
You'll also need to have the following in .../java/lib/javax.comm.properties
#SEE: commapi/PlatformSpecific.html from Sun's commapi package for details.
I've heard some people require a blank line after the line.
Driver=gnu.io.RXTXCommDriver

To use this version you must use javacomm20 or higher. I used "javacomm20-x86.tar.Z" for the comm.jar files and also includes some examples. To run the examples I changed the port opening checks to look for /dev/ttyS0 as my linux didn't have the same devices as the samples expect. 

Good Luck
