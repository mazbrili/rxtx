The system crashes with a NullPointException if you enable notifications
before your register a listener.
 
Example:
    notifyOnDataAvailable(true);
    addEventListener( this );
 
It is OK if you first register the listener, then enable notifications
(which is probably the best thing to do anyway).

DSR does not work reliably for some people.  contrib/DSR-workaround.java
contains a workaround the Ken Eisner contributed.  If you are able to reproduce
the problem and find a fix for RXTX please let the maintainer know.

Buffer Size is just a var.  No memory is allocated.  This was done to duplicate
the behavior in the behavior table in javax.comm.CommPort.html.  Its not clear
to me if the buffers are just mallocs or modem buffers.  Any experts there?

While looking through the blackdown mail list, it was obvious that some people
really want printer support.  Here is a chance to put it in themselves.

ParallelPort and CommPortIdentifier files are provided so you can start 
implementing right away without worrying about how automake works.  They are 
not written in stone.  If you want to do it differently feel free.
The good side is the stuff compiles as is.  

*BSD SerialPort support
	freebsd serial works.
	kernel specific implementations
	buggy event loop.

Win95/98 with mingw32
	The maintainer has integrated Wayne Roberts improvements.  The code
	95% there but needs work.
	for starters look at select()
	http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/techart/msdn_serial.htm
	for documentation.   WaitForSingleObject() may be of use.

RXTXPort.java
	framing control -?-
	buffer control -?-
	look for FIXME

ParallelPort support.  Needs some code.
	files:
		ParallelImp.c stubs 
                      A  large fraction of the stubs are filled in now.
		ParallelImp.h
		LPRPort.java simular to RXTXPort.java + stubs.
	Printer support was working earlier.  Recent kernel changes have 
	probably broken the printer support.  More comments in ParallelImp.c

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
From This point on, You have the wrong version.  All of this work is 
being done in the development branch of the cvs archive.

cvs checkout -r commapi-0-0-1 rxtx-devel 

gets the recent work.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

RS485 Support
	The basic layout is in place with no native implementation.
	devices are not coded into RXTXDriver.java see /dev/ttyS0 and gang
	for examples.
	Nothing is carved in stone.  Changes will probably be needed in
	several of the files.

	files:
		RS485.java
		RS485Port.java
		RS485PortEvent.java
		RS485PortEventListener.java
I2C Support
	The basic layout is in place with no native implementation.
	devices are not coded into RXTXDriver.java see /dev/ttyS0 and gang
	for examples.
	Nothing is carved in stone.  Changes will probably be needed in
	several of the files.

	files:
		I2C.java
		I2CPort.java
		I2CPortEvent.java 
		I2CPortEventListener.java

CommPortIdentifier support. Needs some code.

	This has actually expanded to a complete comm.jar implementation.
	Contact the maintainer if you have interest in working on this.
	Some code is withheld from the distro to maintain traditional jcl
	functionality during the transition.

	./configure --enable-RXTXIDENT will create a Makefile that uses it.
	Plenty of example code can be found in commapi/samples/porting
	Please don't send in Sun's code.  

	files:
		CommDriver.java
		CommPort.java
		CommPortEnumerator.java
		CommPortIdentifier.java
		CommPortOwnershipListener.java
		CpoList.java
		CpoListEntry.java
		OwnershipEventThread.java
		SerialPort.java
		SerialPortEvent.java
		SerialPortEventListener.java
		UnsupportedCommOperationException.java
		NoSuchPortException.java
		OwnershipEventThread.java
		ParallelPort.java
		ParallelPortEvent.java
		ParallelPortEventListener.java
		PortInUseException.java
	
------------------
backwards compatibility for older Linux systems.
------------------
non Linux specific implementations
------------------
allow the library to catch sigint so it can shut down the port properly when
sent
------------------
Add more documentation.
------------------

IDEAS:

Make rxtx apps capable of being spawned from mgetty.  <gluck@tempo-services.com.au>
