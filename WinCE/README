Hi.
Enclosed you'll find a first, alpha-version of rxtx for Windows CE.
It was compiled using Microsoft's eMbedded Visual C++ 3.0 (which is free).
There're source and also binaries for ARM (i.e. Compaq iPAQ).

I didn't enclose .java files since only modifications in them are:
1) adding colon for COM port candidates (COM1: COM2: and so on.) - it
doesn't harm "big" Windows
2) changing library name from "Serial" to "rxtxSerial" since there's
Serial.dll in CE already.

Rest of code is completely rewritten, since CE doesn't have overlapped IO
(and MANY other things), but does non-overlapped better than regular Win32
- simultanous multiple operations on the same handle are OK.
I tried compiling this project under NT (with Visual C++ 6.0) and it
compiles without problems but it doesn't work right because NT doesn't
support simultanous operations without overlapping.
Yes, that means that there's no compatibility between Win32 and Win32CE -
neither direction. I love Microsoft.

Aha, I used unicode everywhere, since both CE and Java use it internally
(CE doesn't have ANSI at all) and I didn't find converting data back and
forth sensible.

Windows CE doesn't have stdio and console at all so I had to make printj()
function. Look at it - it can be quite usable for other projects. Basically
it works like printf() but uses System.out.print() for output.

Will you put this source into CVS or something? I don't know how do you
manage rxtx.
