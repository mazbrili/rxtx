rxtx-2.1 and rxtx-2.0 changes are kept in the same file.  skip to the version
you downloaded.

2.1-7pre18
		release locks when device is unavailable.
		Tico Ballagas <ballagas@cs.rwth-aachen.de>
		J2SE java.util.loggin and property file to match
		Stephane Cachat <stephane@cachat.org>
		termios stack overflow fix for Linux caused by including
		termbits.h
		Bill Holmes <weh@super.org>
		configure fixe for jdk 1.5
2.1-7pre17 Oct 17, 2003
		merged with 2.0 and took small changes from cvs.
2.1-7pre16 Mar 27, 2003
		remove debug "Condition" warnings used to debug NT4 issues.
2.1-7pre15a
		build without requiring rxtxZystem.dll.  Add back the
		TIOCGICOUNT #define for breaks.
2.1-7pre15
		100 fold speedup of read(byte) and read(byte[] ...)
		10 fold speedup of available()
		implementented read(byte[],offset,length,terminator[2]);
		-- not tested.
2.1-7pre14
		select fix that could cause crashes in read and the
		eventLoop
		-- cleaner patch is pending but not tested  as
		mentioned to Melissa and Jauhar.

		Tried to cause exceptions for possible NT4SP6 writes
		-- this was the "Three Blind Mice" test

		Changed build tool chain for XP problems (?).
		-- "XP Blows up"

		Support for COM1-256

		port reenumeration for people that change win32
		port assignments CommPortIdentifier:getPortIdentifiers()
2.1-7pre13
		Isolated lockup on w32 read.
		Added possible fix for w32 write lockups
		throw error on impossible write situations.
		- small input buffer, large writes.
2.1-7pre12
		All input stream methods are synchronized now. 
		I had this in before cleaning up but thought it
		was not needed (nothing failed here).	
		read() will toss an IOException (caught in the
		examples below but not in this library) if read
		thinks there will be a deadlock.
		Some small fixes found while merging with rxtx 2.0
		for public release.  Just sanity checks for library
		versions and such.

		- everything is in synch with the public CVS and
		public prerelease bins are out and being tested.
2.1-7pre11
		fix for lockup found.
		removed Python and Cygwin code (ZystemImp.c)
		removed extra attempts to fix lockup
		removed previous attempts to fix tcrash
		- the solution before was to avoid using the
		API but now it appears to work with it -crazy

2.1-7pre10
		wrote Zystem (probably will be a seperate
		library) for logging over the network. Some
		attempts to fix lockup bugs.
		-pedantic compile passes.
2.1-7pre9
		termios.c cleanup (w32)
2.1-7pre8
		More LPT support for w32
2.1-7pre7
		initial LPT support for w32
2.1-7pre6
		tlockup.m does not lock but fails (?) (W2K SP2)
		tcrash.m does not crash (W2K SP2)
		suite serial passes (W2K SP2)
		debug for flow control and parity switched off.
2.1-7pre5
		Later stage tinkering with flowcontrol and parity
		fixes.  Possibly bugs (w32 has many ways this can
		be setup).
2.1-7pre4
		testRead() now uses //./COM9 to verify port is
		usable (fixes bug introduced in pre3)
		build used java/jar/javac 1.3.1_06-b01
		-- initial tinkering with parity --
2.1-7pre3
		fixed //./COM?? so matlab can do s=serial('COM16')
		-- needed to test tcrash.m
2.1-7pre2
		support for COM1-16 on w32 using //./COM??
2.1-7pre1
		Mark/Space parity fixes on w332

		      Makefile.am remove full path from JAR command.
1.2pre5 Aug 12, 1998  Added David Atkinson's support for which implements event
		      notification, hardware flow control (tested with a modem),
		      multiple bytes reads etc.  Needs to be converted back to
		      termios calls.  Claims to work with blackbox.
		      .cvsignore - Added to ignore generated files such as 
		      "config.h".  It just cleans up CVS reports of what's new

		      Makefile.am - Add a "jcl.jar" target to make a JAR file 
		      for JCL.
		      SerialImp.c - Implemented SerialInputStream_skip().  If 
		      it runs out of memory it uses a slower algorithm which 
		      uses almost no memory.  
		      - Support for baud rates of 38400.  - Rename get_speed to 
		      bps2speed_t (bits-per-second to speed_t constant) to 
		      remove ambiguity.  
		      - The GetSpeed functions now correctly return the bps 
		      speed rather than the speed_t constant.  This means JCL 
		      will now return the correct speed.
		      - Add speed_t2bps to be the reverse of bps2speed_t.
		      - Fix the spelling of "receive".
		      Added /dev/modem to the list of ports because it's very 
		      common.  Added comments from Suns NullDriver sample, 
		      giving credit where necessary.  (Sheldon Young -

1.2pre4 Aug 12, 1998  The CommAPI has changed in the newest beta from Sun,
		      now named "javacomm20-ea".  I have attached RXTXPort.java,
		      which I have modified so it now compiles.

1.2pre3 July 5, 1998  libtool 1.0h, automake 1.3, (redhat-5.1 defaults)
		      added JDK_HOME as and option to configure.
		      missing string control to termios (in progress).
		      documentation changes/updates 
		      (doc and JDK_HOME changes suggested by 
		      fred@rodan.moremagic.com)
		      IOExeption work.
1.2pre2 Jun  5, 1998  termios control from java (overdue)
1.2pre1 May 19, 1998  CommAPI start <kevinh@acm.org (Kevin Hester)>
1.1.5   Mar 17, 1998  mingw (win32) support
1.1.3p7 Feb 26, 1998  change how configure.in finds JAVANATINC
1.1.3p6 Feb 24, 1998  SunOS support (further) 
		      thanks to Gilles Paquet Gilles.Paquet@ulb.ac.be 
		      Added libtool support.  This should fix most Unix
		      porting problems.  
		      added automake.  I'm not convinced it was a good idea.
1.1.3p4 Jan 30, 1998  SunOS support (initial) 
		      thanks to Michael.Forte@Corp.Sun.COM
		      makeraw() fix
1.1.3p3 Jan 18, 1998  added termios(3) functions and FD class javadoc'ed
1,1.3p2 Jan 16, 1998  Complete rewrite.  Now have SerialIn/Output.class's
1,1.3p1 Jan 15, 1998  Speed was not being changed properly 
1.1.3p0 Jan 13, 1998  jdk-1.1.3 fixes.
1.1.1p2 May 23, 1997  Replaced termio with termios.
1.1.1p1 May 22, 1997  obj dirs for different os's.  per request.
1.1.1p0 May 21, 1997  Support for jdk 1.1.1.  Dropped support for 1.0.2
		      because of the jni in 1.1.1.  The native code required 
		      many changes.
0.50    Mar 17, 1997  Buffered input/output use of FileDescriptors.  Removed 
		      most of the native code.  deleted RO.java.  
0.22    Mar 14, 1997  Everything is now controlled from Main.java.  renamed 
		      classes for easier reading.  debug info for open(), 
		      write().  prevent reading from bad fd.  dump hex for RX 
		      as an example in RO.java.
0.21    Mar 12, 1997  Removal of hard coded vars Makefile Removed the last 
		      remnants of my GPS program.  Fixed Main.java by making it
