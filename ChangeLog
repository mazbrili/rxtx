                      multiport use is in.
                      Yeun-Ping Leung contributed FreeBSD support
1.2pre7 Oct 14, 1998  Various Fixes
1.2pre6 Oct  6, 1998  cleaned up documentation.  Pulled out win32 support.
                      Makefile.am remove full path from JAR command.
1.2pre5 Aug 12, 1998  Added David Atkinson's support for which implements event
                      notification, hardwareflow control (tested with a modem),
                      multiple bytes reads etc.  Needs to be converted back to
                      termios calls.  Claims to work with blackbox.

                      .cvsignore - Added to ignore generated files such as 
                      "config.h".  It just cleans up CVS reports of what's new 
                      and different.
                      Makefile.am - Add a "jcl.jar" target to make a JAR file 
                      for JCL.
                      SerialImp.c - Implemented SerialInputStream_skip().  If 
                      it runs out of memory it uses a slower algorithm which 
                      uses almost no memory.  
                      - Support for baud rates of 38400.  - Rename get_speed to 
                      bps2speed_t (bits-per-second to speed_t constant) to 
                      remove ambiguity.  
                      - The GetSpeed functions now correctly return the bps 
                      speed rather than the speed_t constant.  This means JCL 
                      will now return the correct speed.
                      - Add speed_t2bps to be the reverse of bps2speed_t.
                      - Fix the spelling of "recieve".
                      Added /dev/modem to the list of ports because it's very 
                      common.  Added comments from Suns NullDriver sample, 
                      giving credit where necessary.  (Sheldon Young - 
                      sheldon_young@yahoo.com)
                      
                      Commented SerialImp.c (trentjarvi@yahoo.com)
1.2pre4 Aug 12, 1998  The CommAPI has changed in the newest beta from Sun,
                      now named "javacomm20-ea".  I have attached RXTXPort.java,                      which I have modified so it now compiles.
                      Sheldon Young sheldon@intergate.bc.ca
1.2pre3 July 5, 1998  libtool 1.0h, automake 1.3, (redhat-5.1 defaults)
                      added JDK_HOME as and option to configure.
                      missing string control to termios (in progress).
                      documentation changes/updates 
                      (doc and JDK_HOME changes suggested by 
                      fred@rodan.moremagic.com)
                      IOExeption work.

                      Added libtool support.  This should fix most unix
                      porting problems.  
                      added automake.  I'm not convinced it was a good idea.

                      because of the jni in 1.1.1.  The native code required 
                      many changes.
0.50    Mar 17, 1997  Buffered input/output use of FileDescriptors.  Removed 
                      most of the native code.  deleted RO.java.  
0.22    Mar 14, 1997  Everything is now controlled from Main.java.  renamed 
                      classes for easier reading.  debug info for open(), 
                      write().  prevent reading from bad fd.  dump hex for RX 
                      as an example in RO.java.
0.21    Mar 12, 1997  Removal of hard coded vars Makefile Removed the last
