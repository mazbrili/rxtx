		      Yeun-Ping Leung contributed Free-BSD support
1.2pre7 Oct 14, 1998  Various Fixes
1.2pre6 Oct  6, 1998  cleaned up documentation.  Pulled out win32 support.
		      Makefile.am remove full path from JAR command.
1.2pre5 Aug 12, 1998  Added David Atkinson's support for which implements event
		      notification, hardware flow control (tested with a modem),
		      multiple bytes reads etc.  Needs to be converted back to
		      termios calls.  Claims to work with blackbox.
		      .cvsignore - Added to ignore generated files such as 
		      "config.h".  It just cleans up CVS reports of what's new 
		      and different.
		      Makefile.am - Add a "jcl.jar" target to make a JAR file 
		      for JCL.
		      SerialImp.c - Implemented SerialInputStream_skip().  If 
		      it runs out of memory it uses a slower algorithm which 
		      uses almost no memory.  
		      - Support for baud rates of 38400.  - Rename get_speed to 
		      bps2speed_t (bits-per-second to speed_t constant) to 
		      remove ambiguity.  
		      - The GetSpeed functions now correctly return the bps 
		      speed rather than the speed_t constant.  This means JCL 
		      will now return the correct speed.
		      - Add speed_t2bps to be the reverse of bps2speed_t.
		      - Fix the spelling of "receive".
		      Added /dev/modem to the list of ports because it's very 
		      common.  Added comments from Suns NullDriver sample, 
		      giving credit where necessary.  (Sheldon Young - 
		      sheldon_young@yahoo.com)
		      Commented SerialImp.c (trentjarvi@yahoo.com)
1.2pre4 Aug 12, 1998  The CommAPI has changed in the newest beta from Sun,
		      now named "javacomm20-ea".  I have attached RXTXPort.java,
		      which I have modified so it now compiles.
		      Sheldon Young sheldon@intergate.bc.ca
1.2pre3 July 5, 1998  libtool 1.0h, automake 1.3, (redhat-5.1 defaults)
		      added JDK_HOME as and option to configure.
		      missing string control to termios (in progress).
		      documentation changes/updates 
		      (doc and JDK_HOME changes suggested by 
		      fred@rodan.moremagic.com)
		      IOExeption work.
1.2pre2 Jun  5, 1998  termios control from java (overdue)

		      Added libtool support.  This should fix most Unix
		      porting problems.  
		      added automake.  I'm not convinced it was a good idea.
1.1.3p4 Jan 30, 1998  SunOS support (initial) 
		      thanks to Michael.Forte@Corp.Sun.COM
		      makeraw() fix
1.1.3p3 Jan 18, 1998  added termios(3) functions and FD class javadoc'ed

1.1.1p0 May 21, 1997  Support for jdk 1.1.1.  Dropped support for 1.0.2
		      because of the jni in 1.1.1.  The native code required 
		      many changes.
0.50    Mar 17, 1997  Buffered input/output use of FileDescriptors.  Removed 
		      most of the native code.  deleted RO.java.  
0.22    Mar 14, 1997  Everything is now controlled from Main.java.  renamed 
		      classes for easier reading.  debug info for open(), 
		      write().  prevent reading from bad fd.  dump hex for RX 
		      as an example in RO.java.
0.21    Mar 12, 1997  Removal of hard coded vars Makefile Removed the last 
		      remnants of my GPS program.  Fixed Main.java by making it
		      wait for TX to finish (thanks to oliver) Irix support. 
		      (thanks to oliver)
0.2     Mar 11, 1997  added autoconf ability
0.1     Mar 10, 1997  Just tossed the stuff together
