If you want to port rxtx to a new Unix platform do the following.

*IMPORTANT* you will need gnu make.

There are probably three areas you will need to focus on:

	configure.in

	src/SerialImp.c src/SerialImp.h src/ParallelImp.c

	RXTXCommDriver.java  (just add the ports for your OS)

configure.in grabs information about the OS, Java, ... and tries to set sane
values for the Makefile.  Look towards the bottom of configure.in and just
copy *bsd or HP-UX.  Modify to your liking.

Edit configure.in, run autoconf, run configure, run make.  repeat. An endless 
loop analagous to shampoo instructions.

SerialImp.c and ParallelImp.c may require system specific includes and possibly
a small amount of #ifdef's in the code.  Lock file information will need to
be added to SerialImp.h

SerialImp.h will need defines for the location of lock files and the lock file
type if they are used.  See BSD or Linux as examples.

Common problems include the following varibles in the Makefile

      JAVAINCLUDE
      JAVANATINC
      CLASSPATH

Which are defined in configure.in

We will gladly help with any UNIX platform.  Send questions to
trentjarvi@yahoo.com.  New OS's usually require tweaks.

If its not compiling try backing out functionality until it compiles.

win32 support has not been tested.  Contact trentjarvi@yahoo.com if your 
interested in developing win32 support.   

For all Unix flavors... If the package did not work out of the box please
see BUGS and send a comment.
