There are sure to be bugs.  The goal is to make the install as painless
as possible.  Send back comments if something could be easier.

If your not able to open the port (read the errors carefully) then you may
not have permission to use the device.  Redhat linux ships with the following
permissions:

crw-r--r--   /dev/ttyS?

Users need to be able to read and write with serial communication...

chmod 666 /dev/ttyS? 

should fix the problem.

If you run into a problem building the rxtx package please report the following
with the bug report.

   was java in your PATH when you tried ./configure.  'which java'
      JDK_HOME is checked also...
   which machine type are you running on?  'uname -a'
   which jdk version.
       Linux users:  If your trying to use event notification, make sure
       your using the latest native thread package and linux-2.2 kernel.
   which rxtx version.
   what version of libc are you using
   what cc are you using
   which version of commapi you have.

If your having problems with JCL make sure you have read through CommAPI.

with autoconfig/make/libtool/... problems report the following  if they are
not present please install them.

   autoconf --version
   automake --version
   libtool --version
   make --version

Here's whats on my system for comparison.  Correct versions are important.

   autoconf 2.12
   automake 1.3
   libtool 1.2b
   make 3.76.1


mail any bugs to jarvi@ezlink.com.  

Known Bugs.


1.  There is no parallel support in rxtx.  Good project for a interested 
    programmer.  It should not be too hard.  Give it a try!

2.  This release has only been tested on linux in a limited scope.
