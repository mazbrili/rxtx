If your not able to open the port (read the errors carefully) then you may
not have permission to use the device.  Redhat linux ships with the following
permissions:

crw-r--r--   /dev/ttyS?

Users need to be able to read and write with serial communication...

chmod 666 /dev/ttyS? 

should fix the problem.

slackware users:  libc5 slackware/jdk does not compile ansi clean. (!) 
configure --disable-ANSI_CLEAN will remove the -ansi flag.

If you run into a problem building the rxtx package please report the following
with the bug report.

   was java in your PATH when you tried ./configure.  'which java'
      JDK_HOME is checked also...
   which machine type are you running on?  'uname -a'
   which jdk version.
       Linux users:  If your trying to use event notification, make sure
       your using the latest native thread package and linux-2.2 kernel.
   which rxtx version.
   what version of libc are you using
   what cc are you using

If your having problems with JCL make sure you have read through CommAPI.

with autoconfig/make/libtool/... problems report the following  if they are
not present please install them.

   autoconf --version
   automake --version
   libtool --version
   make --version

Here's whats on my system for comparison.  Correct versions are important.

   autoconf 2.12
   automake 1.3
   libtool 1.2b
   make 3.76.1

Known Bugs.

1.  SIGINT (CTL-C) does not work reliably with native threads.  green_threads 
    work as one process ID so signaling works as expected.  It is unknown at 
    this time how to know when the application recieved SIGINT, SIGQUIT... in 
    native threads.

    Actually I'm not sure.  It only happens with test.java.  Must be something
    wrong with the silly thing.  Take a look.  Its probably something easy.

2.  output buffer empty is not implemented. (optional for commapi).  On linux
    this would require modification of the kernel.  Not an easy problem.

3.  input/output buffer sizes do nothing.  Nobody has mentioned a need.

5.  Event notification is only known to work on linux (optional for commapi)

6.  There is no parallel support in rxtx.  Good project for a interested 
    programmer.  It should not be too hard.  Give it a try!

7.  opening and closing a port ~30 times can crash blackbox.  [fixed?].

8.  jdk-1.1.7a1 with glibc-2.1 is hosed stick with glibc-2.  linux-2.2 appears 
    to work.
